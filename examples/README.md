# Sample assignments

We used these "assignments" when testing autograder generation and/or Gradescope's autograder environment. In theory both work, however we make no guarantees.

## collatz-py4j

This is our Py4J test. We also used this as a proof-of-concept of our general autograder design. Upload `Auotgrader.zip` to Gradescope and test using `Collatz.java`. 

## weekdays-generation

A test assignment about days of the week. This was generated with TeachTech Toolkit (see `README.md` in that folder for our test input). We also included a test submission and a few wrong submissions to test against.
